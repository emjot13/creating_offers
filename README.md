<h1 align=center> This program makes creating offers from excel files easy. </h1></br>

One day my dad came to me and said that he needs to send an offer to one of his clients.</br>
He didn't want to just send them an excel file as it wouldn't look professional.</br>
So I told him that I can write some simple code to make such offers.</br>

The program is supposed to work with specific structure of excel files, that the company my dad works with, is using.</br>
The layout is: name, amount of product left, unit in which item is sold, price.</br>
Such layout is neccessary for program to work without any changes (names of the columns are irrelevant).</br>

Functionalities:

- creating offers:
    User inputs the excel file from which data is pulled.</br>
    Then for each category of products that user wants to add:</br>
        User chooses:</br>
        - The way of looking for products in excel file, by matching a phrase, options:</br>
            - matching in the whole products name</br>
            - matching in the beginning of products name</br>
            - matching for individual words in products name</br>
        - The discount for this category</br>

- modifying offers:
    User inputs the excel file and html file (offer to change) from which data is pulled.</br>
    Then they have following options:</br>
        - deleting products from offer</br>
        - adding products to offer</br>
        - changing the discount of products</br>
    For each of above possibilites the user again can choose any of three ways for looking for products.</br></br>

- adding the version to the filename if the input filename already exists:
  User creates an offer with the name "batteries"</br>
  Then if they want to create the file with the same name</br>
  There will be added "_X" at the end of the filename, where X is the lowest number such that</br>
  There isn't a filename with that version number.</br>

The program is written in such a way that it's virtually impossible for a user to cause an error. </br>
The user is being asked for an input that can be accounted for as long as necessary.</br>

Below you can see how part of the offer looks like, flashing red background occurs when this product is not available at the moment </br>
And that's also what added caption "CHWILOWO NIEDOSTÄ˜PNE" means in Polish.
